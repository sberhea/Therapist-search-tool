## Project Proposal

### Overview

I am building a web application that makes it easier to find Black therapists in the Twin Cities. 

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

-I will need to web scrape Psychology Today.
-I will probably also look at a couple of other websites.

### Data

- Therapist name
- Insurance they take
- If they offer sliding scale
- Location
- Credentials
- Contact info
- Speciality

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- Search tool where users can filter therapists based on their need.
- Drop pin map

#### 2.0

- User log in so they can save searches
- Users are able to review
- May I help you bot

#### 3.0

- Beautiful user interface

### Notes

Page 1 = welcome screen with a basic search bar. Maybe asks where the user is located and then pulls up closest therapists. 
Page 2 = the map with the drop pins and a filter above. 
Page 3 = the therapist profile with all the information
Page 4 = the user profile (edit profile, leave a review, saved searches)
